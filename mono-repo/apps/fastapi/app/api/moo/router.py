    Start MOO ranking using a file path to simulation results instead of uploading a file.
    This endpoint is designed for pipeline integration where the simulation data

    **Input:**
    - file_path: Path to simulation result CSV file in shared storage
    - runId: Pipeline run identifier for tracking
    - mileage_limit_before_service: Mileage limit threshold (default: 10000 km)
    
    **Output:**
    - Success/failure status
    - MOO ranking result will be saved to shared storage
    - Webhook notification sent to backend upon completion
    
    **MOO Scoring Algorithm:**
    Same comprehensive scoring as the main `/rank` endpoint with fitness certificates,
    job cards, branding, mileage, wear & tear, cleaning, and operational status.

    ðŸš€ **Universal MOO Train Ranking API** - All functionality in one endpoint!
    
    **Input:**
    - CSV file containing train fleet data
    - Response format: `json` (default), `csv`, or `simple`
    - Mileage limit before service (optional, default: 10000 km)
    
    **Response Formats:**
    - **`json`**: Complete JSON response with detailed train metrics and rankings
    - **`csv`**: Downloadable CSV file (replicates original MOO.py exactly)
    - **`simple`**: Lightweight JSON with only Train ID, Score, and Rank
    
    **MOO Scoring Algorithm:**
    - **Fitness Certificates** (Critical): Rolling Stock (15pts), Signalling (10pts), Telecom (10pts)
    - **Job Cards**: Closed status bonus, penalty for open cards
    - **Branding**: Active campaigns with completion tracking
    - **Mileage**: Service intervals and total mileage considerations
    - **Wear & Tear**: Brakepad and HVAC wear percentages
    - **Cleaning Status**: Cleaning requirements impact
    - **Operational Status**: In-service trains preferred
    - **Shunting**: Penalty for required moves
    
    **Tie-Breaking (5 levels):**
    1. Job card priority (fewer open cards)
    2. Branding completion ratio (lower preferred)
    3. Mileage balance variance (lower preferred) 
    4. Cleaning priority (not required preferred)
    5. Shunting priority (fewer moves preferred)
